In collaboration with Applied Math (ESAM) and Radiology Departments of Northwestern University, we have simulated cardiovascular flows in patient-specific vascular geometries. For that purpose, we have developed a Matlab-based software for building hexahedral meshes from medical images, <font face="verdana" color="green">Biohex</font>. With the help of the developed software, we were able to successfully reconstruct multiple vessel geometries from the medical images of patient arteries taken in vivo by the Northwestern radiology group, and run blood flow simulations with the spectral element solver <a href="http://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov"> Nek5000 </a> developed at Argonne National Laboratory.<br>

<font face="verdana" color="green">Biohex</font> software can be downloaded <a href=http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~peet/biohex.zip>here</a>.
