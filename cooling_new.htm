As thermodynamic cycle analysis shows, gas turbine
efficiency increases with an increase in turbine inlet temperature.
However, maximum achievable turbine inlet temperature is bounded by
the maximum temperature which the blade material can withstand.
Various cooling measures are therefore employed to alleviate heat
loads on the turbine blades. Film cooling acts by supplying
compressor bleed air onto the surface of the blade through the film holes drilled in the surface.
Some of the
major difficulties in developing film cooling strategy is the
sensitivity of the problem to the details of geometrical and
physical conditions, and complex flow dynamics.<br>
<br>
We developed an integrated compressible - low Mach number solver allowing to couple instantaneous dynamics of the flow in the plenum, film hole and above the blade surface in a situation where flow regimes range from supersonic (external flow) to almost stagnating (plenum, M~10^-4) [1]. With the developed solver, we performed LES simulations of film cooling flow issued from an array of inclined cylindrical holes into a flat plate turbulent boundary layer [2, 3]. Accurate modeling of all pertinent geometry components combined with an accurate desciption of the turbulence field (LES method) allowed us to obtain good agreement with experiments. As a result of this study, we investigated flow physics and vorticity dynamics associated with the plenum-jet-crossflow interaction, described the evolution of coherent
vortical structures in the near field of injected jet and studied the influence of coherent vortical structures on thermal
properties, such as adiabatic film cooling effectiveness.
